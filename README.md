##### Part 1: Intro and setup
---
First we need to use express to generate a new project:

```
Terminal: express shopping-cart --view=hbs
```
Then we navigate to the project folder and run __npm install__ to install all dependencies.

Now just by accessing __http://localhost:3000/__ at chrome we can see Express is already installed.

We need to do some cleanup. we delete users.js under routes. and inside app.js we delete some lines related to users route.

Then we import Bootstrap cdn and jquery into layout.hbs and we are all set.
